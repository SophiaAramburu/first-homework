## Horiseon Website Code Refactor

**Goal**
- My main goal in this assignment was to practice refactoring website codes to make a better semantic HTML. My other main goal was to understand the importance of having experiance of meeting accessibility standards. I did my best to make sure the website was cleaner and more accessible than how it was given to me. 

**Revisions**
- I condensed a lot of the elements on the CSS Stylesheet to ensure that they were way cleaner and easieer to look at. I condensed the style elements as well as the tags and selectors. 

-There were a few things I was able to do in the HTML file to make it more conclusive and well-built. I added an ID to fix the link that wasn't working so it was functional. Next, I added alt image attributes that were much needed for strong accessibility. Lastly, I changed all the non descriptive tags with semantic HTML to work with accessibilty. 
- I finished by adding notes to the style sheet and the index.html page. It reads a description of what is happening within the stylesheet and html page.
